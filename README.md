## Problem Statement
The restaurant sales data contains information about the items sold, transaction amounts, transaction types, and time of sale. The restaurant wants to analyze the data to identify trends, patterns, and insights that can help improve sales, optimize menu offerings, and enhance customer satisfaction. The restaurant aims to increase revenue, attract new customers, and retain existing customers by leveraging data-driven insights and strategies.

## Data Collection
The data is collected from the restaurant's sales records, which include information about the items sold, transaction amounts, transaction types, time of sale, and other relevant details. The data is stored in a CSV file and loaded into a pandas DataFrame for analysis.

## Data Cleaning
The data is cleaned by standardizing column names, handling missing values, converting data types, and removing duplicates. The data is checked for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies to ensure data quality and integrity.

## Data Transformation
The data is transformed by extracting date, month, year, and month-year information from the date column. The data is converted to datetime format for time series analysis. The data is aggregated and summarized to analyze sales trends, item performance, transaction types, and time of sale.

## Data Analysis
The data is analyzed to identify trends, patterns, and insights that can help improve sales, optimize menu offerings, and enhance customer satisfaction. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and descriptive statistics to provide actionable recommendations for the restaurant.

## Time Series Analysis
The data is analyzed using time series analysis to identify trends, patterns, and insights over time. The data is aggregated by month-year and item type to analyze total transaction amounts and trends. Linear regression is performed to model the relationship between date and transaction amount for each item type.

## Conclusion
The analysis provides insights into sales trends, item performance, transaction types, time of sale, and other key factors that can help the restaurant improve sales, optimize menu offerings, and enhance customer satisfaction. The restaurant can use these insights to develop data-driven strategies, make informed decisions, and achieve its business goals.

## Recommendation
Based on the analysis, the restaurant can implement the following recommendations to improve sales, optimize menu offerings, and enhance customer satisfaction:
1. Promote high-performing products to increase sales.
2. Analyze low-selling items to identify opportunities for improvement.
3. Optimize sales strategies based on time of sale analysis.
4. Explore other factors influencing sales to develop accurate forecasts.
